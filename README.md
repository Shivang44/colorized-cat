# ccat
Turn those boring cat outputs into colorized (syntax-highlighted) outputs!

# Installation (Doesn't work yet, need to publish to npm)
npm install -g ccat

# Usage
ccat YOUR_FILE

Easy as that. ccat supports over 150 languages due to the fact that it uses prism.js to tokenize and calculate the syntax highlighting for each token!
