# ccat
Turn those boring cat outputs into colorized (syntax-highlighted) outputs!

# Installation
`npm install -g colorized-cat`

# Usage
`ccat YOUR_FILE`

Easy as that. ccat supports over 150 languages due to the fact that it uses prism.js to tokenize and calculate the syntax highlighting for each token!
