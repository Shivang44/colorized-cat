# ccat
Turn those boring cat outputs into colorized (syntax-highlighted) outputs!

ccat supports over 150 languages due to the fact that it uses [PrismJS](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) to tokenize and calculate the syntax highlighting for each token!


# Installation
You can clone and install it locally, but to make it easy, this utility is published as an [npm module.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colorized-cat)

`npm install -g colorized-cat`

# Usage
`ccat YOUR_FILE`
